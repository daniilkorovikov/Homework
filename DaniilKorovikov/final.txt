Session 3

1. Create a local folder and initialize it for git;
mkdir hw_3
cd hw_3
git init

2. Create a text file in the folder and commit it;
touch text.txt
git add text.txt
git commit -m 'Add text.txt'

3. Create a remote repository on GitHub;
git remote add origin git@github.com:daniilkorovikov/hw_3.git

4. Push the local repository to GitHub;
git push origin master

5. Create a new branch (develop) and switch to it;
git checkout -b develop
git push origin develop

6. Create a new branch from 'develop' and switch to it;
git checkout -b feature/1

7. Add the first line in the text file, commit, and push to remote;
vim text.txt  # First line
git add text.txt
git commit -m 'Write first line'
git push origin feature/1

8. Clone your repository from GitHub into a separate folder;
cd ..
mkdir hw_3_clone
cd hw_3_clone
git clone git@github.com:daniilkorovikov/hw_3.git
cd hw_3

9. Create another branch from 'develop' and switch to it using cloned project;
git checkout develop
git checkout -b 'feature_2'

10. Add the first line of the text file (different from the first branch), commit, and push on remote;
vim text.txt # Another line
git add text.txt
git commit -m  ‘Add line 'Another line’
git push origin feature_2

11. Switch to develop;
git checkout develop

12 Merge the first branch and push changes;
git merge feature/1

13. Merge the second branch and push changes;
git merge feature_2

14. Resolve conflict;
vim text.txt
<<<<<<HEAD
First line
——————
Another line
>>>>>>> feature_2

First line
Another line

15. Commit and push a separate text file with a list of all the commands, which were used to solve the problem;
git add text.txt 
git commit -m 'Resolve conflict'
git push origin develop
